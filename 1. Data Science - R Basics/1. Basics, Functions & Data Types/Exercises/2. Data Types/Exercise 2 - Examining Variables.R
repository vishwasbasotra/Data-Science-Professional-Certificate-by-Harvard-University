"Use the accessor $ to extract the state abbreviations and 
assign them to the object 'a'. What is the class of this 
object?"

# To access the population variable from the murders 
# dataset use this code:
p <- murders$population 

# To determine the class of object `p` we use this code:
class(p)

# Use the accessor to extract state abbreviations and 
# assign it to a

# Determine the class of a
a <- murders$abb
