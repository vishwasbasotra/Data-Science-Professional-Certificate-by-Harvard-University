"Create a vector of numbers that starts at 6, does not go 
beyond 55, and adds numbers in increments of 4/7. So the 
first three numbers will be 6, 6+4/7, and 6+8/7. How many 
numbers does the list have? Use only one line of code to 
answer both questions."

# Create a sequence of numbers from 6 to 55, with 4/7
# increments and determine its length
length(seq(6,55,4/7))
