"This time we will use just the : operator. Use the
':' operator to create a sequence of consecutive integers 
starting at 12 and ending at 73 and save it in an object x, 
then determine the length of object x."

# Create a vector m of integers that starts at 32 and ends at 99.
m <- 32:99

# Determine the length of object m.
length(m)

# Create a vector x of integers that starts at 12 and ends at 73.
x <- 12:73
# Determine the length of object x.
length(x)
